## Create a great event
Create an Event through your account to connect to your audience and empower them to spend time together in the real world.

## Make it easy for people to discover your event
### Choose an event photo
Your photo appears differently across desktop and mobile so it should be 1920 x 1080 pixels (16:9 ratio) or larger with little or no text.

### Use a clear and short event name
Long names can get cut off, so avoid duplicating location information in the name and donâ€™t use capital letters or symbols that can be hard to read. 

### Add a location
Use a location of your event so people nearby can discover and learn about your event. Otherwise, use the full address including the city. 

### Set a specific date & time
Your event should be tied to a specific date and time so people can discover it. For events longer than two weeks, create separate events with their own time and location.

### Add tags
Input keywords to make it easier for people to find your event.

### Edit event details
You can make edits leading up to the event. However, once you reach a large number of responses, you can only change the time or location of the event three times. Once the event begins, you will not be able to edit the event details. 

### Add Limit
You can set a max number of participants in your event.
